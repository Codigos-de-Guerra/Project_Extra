## Aluno

[Daniel Oliveira Guerra](https://github.com/Codigos-de-Guerra)

### Description
On this project, we are encouraged to imagine ourselves as candidates to work for a multinacional company as Data Scientists. By receiveing a dataset containing all 'MEGASENA' results, we shall abstract concise and meaningful informations about it. Through explanation, and exemplification, each one of us must prove our affirmations and conclusions. This activity will prove our knowledge on Python resources, problem solving and capacity on creative solving.

### Why?
As a graduating student on Bachelor of Information Technology at [UFRN](http://www.ufrn.br/)(Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte), there is a mandatory subject called 'Probabilidade', which my professor [Ivanovitch Silva](https://github.com/ivanovitchm) passed us this extra project to be made with Python.
