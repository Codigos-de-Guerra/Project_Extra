### Description
On this project, we are encouraged to imagine ourselves as candidates to work for a multinacional company as Data Scientists. By receiveing a dataset containing all 'MEGASENA' results, we shall abstract concise and meaningful informations about it. Through explanation, and exemplification, each one of us must prove our affirmations and conclusions. This activity will prove our knowledge on Python resources, problem solving and capacity on creative solving.

### Why?
As a graduating student on Bachelor of Information Technology at [UFRN] (http://www.ufrn.br/)(Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte), there is a mandatory subject called 'Probabilidade', which my professor Ivanovitch passed us this extra project to be made with Python.

## Result
Finally, in the end I were able to make several observations and deductions, just from the informations provided to me via dataset. These same deductions, which lead me to ponder more about 'MegaSena' and the benefits to  the involved ones. And also, how incredibly rare it is to get right all 6 numbers! Hahaha.
